## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`leetcode/`** - LeetCode problem solutions covering a wide range of algorithmic challenges  
- **`Algorithm/`** - General algorithm implementations (e.g., dynamic programming, graph algorithms)  
- **`Amazon_oa/`** - Amazon online assessment practice problems  
- **`Shopify_oa/`** - Shopify online assessment practice problems  
- **`TikTok_oa/`** - TikTok online assessment practice problems  
- **`minimax.py`** - Minimax algorithm implementation  
- **`test.py`** - Testing utilities

## ‚ö° Usage

Each Python file is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
python3 leetcode/MinimumWindowSubstring.py
python3 Algorithm/CoinChange.py
python3 Amazon_oa/amazon_fitness_tracker.py
```

Most solutions include test cases in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section to demonstrate usage and verify correctness.
