947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points.
Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares a row or column with another stone
that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents
the location of the ith stone, return the maximum number of stones that
can be removed.
